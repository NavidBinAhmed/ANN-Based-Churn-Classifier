# Overview
The repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Deep Learning model for predicting the churn classifier of a Financial Institution, i.e. Bank. 
A churn predictor for a bank is developed using Artificial Neural Network architecture. 

# What is Churn Rate 
Churn rate measures the number of customers or employees who leave the bank during a given period.
